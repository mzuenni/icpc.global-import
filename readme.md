A small hacky script to import teams into the icpc.global system.

to import teams you need a `.csv` file with the following fields:
- `Participant First Name`
- `Participant Name`
- `Participant E-Mail`
- `Team Name`
- `Contestsite`
- `Affiliation Name`
- `Contestsiteorganizer` (will be added as coach)

Note that affiliation, contestsite and contestsiteorganizer should already exist in the icpc system.
